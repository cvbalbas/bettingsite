#5 MULTIPLY the probability of each team from "half time" and "second half result" together
e.g (half time Paris) times (second half result Paris)
Half Time 
m 1.95 => 0.5128
draw 2.60 => 0.3846
z 6.50 => 0.1538
---------
total = 1.0512

Normalised Half Time
m 0.5128 / 1.0512 = 0.4878 => 2.05
Draw: 0.3846 / 1.0512 = 0.3659 => 2.73
Z: 0.1538 / 1.0512 = 0.1462 => 6.84


Second Half Result 
m 1.85 => 0.5405
draw 3 => 0.3333
z 5.50 => 0.1818
---------
total: 1.0556

Normalised second half result
M: 0.5405 / 1.0556 = 0.5120 => 1.95
Draw: 0.3333 / 1.0556 = 0.3160 => 3.16
Z: 0.1818 / 1.0556 = 0.1720=> 5.81


Halftime × second half = normalised Win Both Halves
m: 0.4878 x 0.5120 = 0.2499 => 4.00
z: 0.1462 x 0.1720 = 0.0251 => 39.8

put a timestamp in each data element in oddschecker 
every 10 mins, check each timestamp from markets, whichever is oldest, update that.
